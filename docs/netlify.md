## Create a Netlify account
Go to app.netlify.com and select your preferred signup method. This will likely be a hosted Git provider, although you also have the option to sign up with an email address.

The following examples use GitHub, but other git providers will follow a similar process.

Selecting GitHub will bring up an authorization modal for authentication. Select “Authorize application.”

## Create a New Site with Continuous Deployment
You’re now already a Netlify member and should be brought to your new dashboard. Select “New site from git.”

Netlify will then start walking you through the steps necessary for continuous deployment. First, you’ll need to select your git provider again, but this time you are giving Netlify added permissions to your repositories.

And then again with the GitHub authorization modal:

Select the repo you want to use for continuous deployment. If you have a large number of repositories, you can filter through them in real time using repo search:

Once selected, you’ll be brought to a screen for basic setup. Here you can select the branch you wanted published, your build command, and your publish (i.e. deploy) directory. The publish directory should mirror that of what you’ve set in your site configuration, the default of which is public. The following steps assume you are publishing from the master branch.

## Build and Deploy Site
In the Netlify console, selecting “Deploy site” will immediately take you to a terminal for your build:

Once the build is finished—this should only take a few seconds–you should now see a “Hero Card” at the top of your screen letting you know the deployment is successful. The Hero Card is the first element that you see in most pages. It allows you to see a quick summary of the page and gives access to the most common/pertinent actions and information. You’ll see that the URL is automatically generated by Netlify. You can update the URL in “Settings.”

>Now every time you push changes to your hosted git repository, Netlify will rebuild and redeploy your site.
